This repo contains the code to replicate my thesis. Access to data and charts can be arranged upon request.

Code is available in the R directory. There are 4 R scripts:

1. Process AQ Data loads, formats, and fills in the missing AOD data. It then matches it with PM2.5 data.

2. Process Copernicus data processes the data from the ECMWF

3. AOD-PM2.5 Modelling produces our PM2.5 forecasts

4. PM2.5 - ED Presentations models the relationship between PM2. and AOD. It also runs our simulations.
